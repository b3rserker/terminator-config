# terminator-config

This is my "terminator" terminal emulator config.

It is supposed to be integrated with byobu terminal emulator
and it serves as bottom layer (rendering, copy/paste, character
encoding needs only). Everything else is handled by byobu
terminal multiplexer and its config above.
See https://github.com/b3rserker/byobu-config .

Made for terminator version 0.98.
